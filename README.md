A machine learning project predicting residential home prices in Ames, Iowa using advanced regression techniques. This is our team's collaborative learning journey through the famous Kaggle competition.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Competition**: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)  
**Goal**: Predict the final sale price of homes based on 79 explanatory features  
**Problem Type**: Supervised Learning - Regression  
**Evaluation Metric**: Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle account (for data download)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheBoss7660/PricePredictionTeam.git
   cd house-price-team
   
2. **Install required packages**
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost jupyter
   
3. **Download competition data**
   - Go to Kaggle Competition Page
      **Step-by-step:**

  I.   **Go to the official competition page:*
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
  II.  **Scroll slightly and look for the “Data” tab (usually after “Overview”).*
  III. **Inside the Data tab, you will find:*
         - train.csv → your training dataset
         - test.csv → dataset for predictions
         - data_description.txt → detailed explanation of each feature
         - sample_submission.csv → sample submission format
  IV.  **Click Download All*
       This gives you a ZIP file containing all the datasets.
         - Download train.csv and test.csv
         - Place them in data/raw/ folder
     
4. **Start exploring**
   - jupyter notebook
  

  ## Our Approach
### Phase 1: Exploration & Understanding
   - Comprehensive EDA of 79 features
   - Identify relationships with SalePrice
   - Detect missing values and outliers
   - Visualize key patterns and correlations

### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values strategically
   - Create new informative features
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and transformation

### Phase 3: Model Development
   - Baseline Models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
   - Tree-based Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
   - Ensemble Methods: Model stacking and blending
   - Hyperparameter Tuning: Cross-validation and grid search

### Phase 4: Submission & Improvement
   - Generate prediction files
   - Submit to Kaggle leaderboard
   - Analyze errors and iterate
   - Final model selection

##  Technologies Used
   - Programming: Python
   - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
   - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
   - Environment: Jupyter Notebook
   - Version Control: Git & GitHub

##  Key Features Explored
   - Location: Neighborhood, proximity to amenities
   - Size: Square footage, room counts, lot size
   - Quality: Overall condition, material quality
   - Age: Year built, renovation history
   - Amenities: Garage, basement, pool, fireplace

## How We Collaborate
